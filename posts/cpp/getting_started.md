First of all, you're going to need a windows computer. Also, you're going to need a compiler. The best compiler(in my opinon), is Dev-C++.  
The download link is [here (sourceforge)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dev-cpp/)

![You should get something like this](/images/cpp/download.jpg)

Go ahead and install it

![Installing](/images/cpp/install.jpg)

Just leave all the options as-is, unless you know what you're doing

![Install it where it says](/images/cpp/directory.jpg)

Install it onto C:\\ like it says, it makes everything easier

It might give you a message asking about code completion function. Don't bother with it, you don't need it yet

![It should look like this](/images/cpp/sucess.jpg)

If you get this, you're good to go!
