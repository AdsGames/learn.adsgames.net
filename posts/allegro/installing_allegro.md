title: "Installing Allegro with Dev-C++"
---

There are two ways to install Allegro:

\*Note: #1 is easier, #2 is for if #1 doesn't work

1\. Open up Dev-C++ and go to Tools>Check for Updates/Packages

![The tools dropdown menu](/images/allegro/tools.png)

Go the "Select devpack server" dropdown menu and select devpacks.org, and click "Check for updates"

![Select devpacks.org](/images/allegro/devpacks.org.png)

If you get an error message like below, you will need to go #2. If it downloads the package list, you will be fine.

Next, go to the "groups" dropdown menu, and select Allegro.

2\. If the Dev-C++ package installer doesn't work, use these steps.  
[Here is an external link to Allegro.(sourceforge)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/files/allegro-bin/4.2.1/allegro-4.2.1-1mol.DevPak/download?use_mirror=hivelocity)

Double click the file, and the installer should load.

If not, right click on the file, and go to "Open With", and browse to your Dev-C++ folder, and open with packman.exe

Using both methods, a install window like this(below) will pop up. Go ahead and install it, it only takes a few seconds.
