Allegro is an easy-to-use, free and open source, game and software engine. It can draw 2D shapes and images, and play sound files, and draw basic 3D.

According to the [Allegro website](https://liballeg.org/) it says: "Allegro is a cross-platform, libraries mainly aimed at video game and multimedia programming. They  
handle common, low-level tasks such as creating windows, accepting user input, loading data, drawing images,  
playing sounds, etc. and generally abstracting away the underlying platform.

According to the Oxford Companion to Music, Allegro is the Italian for "quick, lively, bright". It is also a recursive  
acronym which stands for "Allegro Low LEvel Game ROutines". Allegro was started by Shawn Hargreaves in the  
mid-90's but has since received contributions from hundreds of people over the net."
